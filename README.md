# idid what?

Simple CLI to keep track of what I did. Data is stored in a text file, and the format is quite simple. <date-time> <msg>

## API
idid new : create a new idid entry
idid what <period>: displayes what you did last period `lastday|lastweek|lastmonth`

## Todo
- [x] Make storage file configurable
- [ ] Optional date argument for new
- [ ] Pretty printing
  - [ ] Group by date
  - [ ] Colored output
